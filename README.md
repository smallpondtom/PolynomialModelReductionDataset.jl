# Polynomial Model Reduction Dataset for Partial Differential Equations

This is a dataset including various polynomial structured ODEs which are derived from large-scale PDEs and etc.
We aim to accelerate the development of novel model reduction approaches by making this dataset available to researchers and scientists.
